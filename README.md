## NOTE
The new Xsens DOT PC SDK to develop PC-based applications is now ready! It is possible to download it from our Xsens DOT developer page (https://www.xsens.com/developer). The Xsens DOT Server, an example code for the BLE service specification, **is then archived**.

## Overview
Xsens DOT Server is a simple web server that can scan, connect and start measurement with Xsens DOT on Windows, macOS and Raspberry Pi. The system is built using Node.js in combination with [Noble](https://github.com/abandonware/noble). 

**Functions**
* Scan sensor
* Connect sensor
* Synchronization
* Real-time streaming - While you can get all measurement modes (exclude high fidelity modes), 6 modes are currently supported in Xsens DOT Server:
  * Complete (Euler)
  * Extended (Quaternion)
  * Rate quantities (with mag)
  * Custom mode 1
  * Custom mode 2
  * Custom mode 3
* Data logging
* Heading reset

  * Keep clicking **Next** to complete the installation.
  * Enter `npm -v` in command prompt to check if the installation is successful.<br>
&nbsp;<img height="60" src="images/image002.gif"/>

* Install [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
   ```sh
   npm install -g node-gyp
   ```
* Install all the required tools and configurations using Microsoft's [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) from an elevated PowerShell or CMD.exe (run as Administrator)
   ```sh
   npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
   ```
* Install [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) to setup WinUSB driver:
  * Find Bluetooth adapter inforamtion in Device Manager <br>
&nbsp;<img height="250" src="images/image006.gif"/>
  * Open Zadig, goto **Options**, enable "**List All Devices**"
  * Find your Bluetooth adapter, change the driver to **WinUSB**. Then click **Replace Driver** <br>
&nbsp;<img height="200" src="images/image007.gif"/>

  * Note: please retry several times if the intallation fails. Or restart the computer and try again. 


### Set up on macOS
#### Install following tools
* Install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) 
* Install [node.js 8.9.4](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.9.4/)
  * You can install [*n*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n) package to easily manage Node.js versions.

**Note**: For some operating systems (e.g. macOS), the address is not available unless a connection has been established first. If this is the case, the address of the peripheral is set to a counter. This address will be used until the server is restarted and the sensor is discovered again.

### Set up on Raspberry Pi
#### Prerequisites
* Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB RAM / Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, 1 GB RAM
* Install [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/)

#### Installation steps
* Install dependcies 
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev
  sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall libssl-dev
  ```

* Download Node.js 8.x: 
  ```sh
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
  ```
 * Install `npm`:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install npm
   ```
 * Install Node.js 8.x: 
   ```sh

   node -v
   ```

## Run Xsens DOT Server
1. Clone repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/xsens/xsens_dot_server.git
   ```
1. Enter Xsens DOT Server project `cd ./xsens_dot_server` and install the dependency package `npm install`
1. Run Xsens DOT Server
   * Windows and macOS: `node xsensDotServer`
   * Raspberry Pi: `sudo node xsensDotServer`
1. Open Xsens DOT server in browser
   * Run http://localhost:8080/ or http://127.0.0.1:8080/ you are able to use Xsens DOT Server!

## Run on Docker

A Dockerfile is available to run the server from. Build the image like:

```cmd
cd xsens_dot_server
docker build . -t xsens_dot_server 
```

When running the container, Bluetooth must be made available. This is accomplished the most easily by running it with the `--net host` and `--privileged` option. This will effectively share the Bluetooth driver with the host.

To keep the logged data, bind the `data` folder to a host folder.

A complete example command, in interactive mode:

```cmd
docker run --net host --privileged -it --rm -v ~/Xsens_data:/root/xsens_dot_server/data xsens_dot_server
```

While it's running you can access the web interface outside the container on port 8080, since it's in host mode. Without the `--net host` option you should make the port available like `-p 8080:8080`.

## Known issues
1. [Connection] Unable to connect sensors in Mac with Bluetooth 5.0.
1. [Connection] Connection with firmware 1.3.0 sensors may fail in Windows. You can:
   * use firmware 1.0.0
   * or use a Bluetooth dongle which support 4.0 or above. Refer to [Add Bluetooth adapter](#add-bluetooth-adapter) to configure your Bluetooth dongle.

## Troubleshooting
#### Add Bluetooth adapter
If you encounter `Error: No compatible USB Bluetooth 4.0 device found!` when try to run Xsens DOT Sever on Windows, it means you need to add your Bluetooth adapter to the USB device list:
 1. Open Device Manager, find the VID and PID of your Bluetooth adapter.<br>
&nbsp;<img height="300" src="images/image011.gif"/>
 2. Open source code: *xsens_dot_server\node_modules\bluetooth-hci-socket\lib\usb.js*
 3. Add Bluetooth VID & PID in usb.js (line 66), save and close.<br>
&nbsp;<img height="80" src="images/image012.gif"/>
 4. Run Xsens DOT Server again.
 
 #### Reinstall Bluetooth adapter
 After replacing the Bluetooth adapter with WinUSB driver, you cannot connect to Bluetooth devices with your PC. Here is the way to reinstall the Bluetooth adapter:
  1. Go to **Device Manager** -> **Universal Serial Bus devices**
  2. Find your converted WinUSB driver and uninstall
  3. In **Device Manager**, go to **Action** (top menu), then **Scan for hardware changes** and let it reinstall
  4. You should able to find your Bluetooth adapter back in **Bluetooth**.
